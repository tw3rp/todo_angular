#Todo list 
## Synopsis
This is a small todo web app which uses angular for the front end and uses mongoDB as the database. It uses express framework of node.js for the javascript. The data is passed using http post get and delete. The front-end also uses angular for elegance

## Code Example

This is a RESTful api based webapp which calls particular custom APIs 

sample code 

'''
 function(req,res){ 
        TODO.find({},function(err,todos){                               
                if(err) res.send(err);                                          });
                getTodos(res);                                              });
